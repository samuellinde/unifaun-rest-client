Basically, a shipment consists of at least two parties (sender and receiver), service definition and parcel definition. There are three different methods available that can be used to create a shipment:
- Stored shipment method stores the shipment for later printing.
- Consolidated shipment method returns printed documents immediately and allows continuous printing of labels while holding the EDI message until a close message is received.
- Shipment method returns printed documents immediately.
